# Finance_App
Finance application to track my personal financial data. No sensitive information is contained in the code. Must upload two files- Transaction data (Columns: Date,Bank RTN,Account Number,Transaction Type,Description,Debit,Credit,Check Number,Account Running Balance) and lookup table (Account Number, Account Name)
The app with only run with these two files
It is formed and tailored to my personal finances
The point of uploading the lookup table is so the code contains no sensitive information
